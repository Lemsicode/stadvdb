# STADVDB Project

There are two projects in this single repository. Don't fret to the two `package.json`, because it's intended. You will have to configure the Client and the Server respectively.

## Server Configuration
1. Inside the server folder, run CMD, and type `npm install`
2. Run the server by typing `npm run devStart` in the Command Line.

## Client Configuration
1. Go inside the client folder, run CMD, and type `npm install`
2. Run the client side by typing `npm start` in the Command Line.
